Oh, hello. I see you're not the usual guild clerk.
Never the less, I look forward to working with you and am willing to take any quests you have to offer.
I am a fully trained knight, however I'm getting quite old, so I am getting a little slower I'm afraid.
[GQ] That sounds like something I can do. I'll complete this task to the best of my abilities
[DE] Whatever the outcome, I look forward to our next meeting, good bye.
Hello again. It looks like we will be seeing a lot of eachother in the future.
[QD]
I don't wish to hold up this line for too long, do you have any quests for me today?
[GQ] Oh, that sounds like it could be amusing. I look forward to it.
[DE] Well I'll be going again. I look forward to seeing you next time
Good morning... I realized I haven't asked your name yet. I'm sorry.
My name is Lucky (subject to change). I've been adventureing my entire life, it's all I know.
I'm getting a bit too old for this, but it would be impossible to find a new job at my age. *chuckle*
Any ways, I'm not getting any younger so what job do you have for me today
[GQ] Thank you, this sound just right for me.
[DE] You're a quiet one, but I can tell you mean no disrespect. I'll see you again next time.
Busy day it seems, you must be tired. I respect your dedication to your job

Well enough of this old dog monolouging, what kind of quest do you have for me today?
