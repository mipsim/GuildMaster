This quest was quite difficult. I was unsure of my success all throughout the quest as I am not used to tracking. I was able to sussessfuly able to lead the bird away and search through the bird's excrement. When I found him he was passed out due to the smell and quite dehydrated. However he was still alive and I expect him to make a full recovery.
I am sorry to admit I was unable to complete this quest. I am not as young as I used to be and was unable to tie the rope around the stiltbird's legs fast enough. I apologize for my incompetance and I hope you are able to find someone who can compleete this quest before the deadline
I was unable to complete this quest. I was worried when you gave me the quest initially that I would be unable to meet the client's expectations. I remember trying to race up stiltbird legs whith my friends when I was young, however those days are far behind me. I did try my best, but I was unable to reach the child. I hope he is rescued by a more competant adventureur soon.
